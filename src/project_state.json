  "architectural_notes": [
    "Consensus meetings use group-based ranking system where participants rank contributions from first to last place",
    "Rankings are submitted as ordered arrays of user IDs (e.g., [User1, User2, User3, User4])",
    "Current consensus logic requires 100% agreement but should check for majority agreement within each group",
    "Groups are assigned during Sign-up phase (max 6/group, min 3/group)",
    "REP distribution uses Fibonacci-based logic; PHIL rewards are proportional to REP"
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Consensus detection fails when 3/4 participants submit matching ranks - requires 100% agreement instead of majority",
    "Consensus logic needs refactoring to count ranking patterns and detect majority support (≥50%+1)"
