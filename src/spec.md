# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the LoginPage fully bilingual with French and English language support.

**Planned changes:**
- Update LoginPage component to use translation keys for all text content (mission statement, feature descriptions, button labels)
- Add comprehensive French translations for all LoginPage strings to the translations system
- Ensure language switching updates LoginPage text immediately

**User-visible outcome:** Users can view the LoginPage in either English or French by toggling the language selector, with all content (hero title, mission statement, feature cards, and login button) displaying in their selected language.
